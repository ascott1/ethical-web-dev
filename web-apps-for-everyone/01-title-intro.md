# Introduction

My wife and I began dating in 2003 and within a year or so I became her family’s default “computer expert.” In 2005 I helped my father in-law pick out a new computer for himself. To him this was akin to an appliance purchase and we picked out a sturdy desktop computer, which has been in continuous use since then. We’ve made some upgrades to the RAM and I’ve done my best to point him to using an evergreen browser that automatically updates, but those no longer update on his aged XP system. When I asked him why he doesn’t upgrade, he just shrugs and says “it still works.” 

In 1998 Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, published [The World Wide Web: A very short personal history](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ShortHistory.html). In this brief essay he states:

> The dream behind the Web is of a common information space in which we communicate by sharing information. Its universality is essential: the fact that a hypertext link can point to anything, be it personal, local or global, be it draft or highly polished.

To Berners-Lee the universality of the web is exactly that which allowed the web to grow from a single server at his desk to a global communication network with over 3 billions users worldwide[^1]. While built upon the technologies established in those early days of the web, today's web has grown beyond the concept of hyperlinked documents. Today we build rich graphical interfaces that encompass anything from a text document to a real-time video application while also providing for many their primary means for personal interaction, information, and fundamental social services.

With the rise of information and immersive applications on the web, we have created a global network that is heavily relied upon by society. Pausing to think about this, it is a beautiful thing and, true to Berners-Lee’s vision, there remains little barrier to entry to publishing a site or application. However, as web developers it is a professional and social responsibility to ensure that our sites and applications work for as many people as possible. 

I have often been tempted to disregard browser or device testing so that it allows me to use the latest and greatest tools and browser features. Learning to use these new tools is one of the things that make web development so enjoyable, but we must temper this desire with the ability to build sites that work for as many users as possible. These may be lesser featured, but we should avoid shutting out users or denying them our services. When we do this, we are taking an elite position, potentially shutting out the poor, disabled, and elderly. Imagine a storefront who didn’t allow customers to enter if their shoes and clothes were too old. As a society we would find that offensive and the shopkeeper would likely be publicly disgraced on the evening news. However, we often put banners on our site that say “This site only supports X browser or newer” when a visitor accesses it with an older browser. Or worse, the site will silently fail, akin the shopkeeper refusing to open the till and take payment.
