# Introduction

In 1998 Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, published [The World Wide Web: A very short personal history](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ShortHistory.html). In this brief essay he states:

> The dream behind the Web is of a common information space in which we communicate by sharing information. Its universality is essential: the fact that a hypertext link can point to anything, be it personal, local or global, be it draft or highly polished.

To Berners-Lee the "universality" of the web is what allowed the web to grow from a single server at his desk to a global communication network with over 3 billions users worldwide[^1]. While built upon the technologies established in those early days of the web, today's web has grown beyond the concept of hyperlinked documents. Today we build rich graphical interfaces that encompass anything from a text document to a real-time video application.
