## Introduction

POUR principle: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

## Accessibility as a social issue

## Understanding WCAG 2.0

## Using a screen reader to navigate the web

- [ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) & [ChromeVox tutorial](http://www.chromevox.com/tutorial/index.html)

### OS screen readers

- [VoiceOver for Mac](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/): CMD + F5 to enable
- [Narrator for Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hear-text-read-aloud-narrator#1TC=windows-8)

Navigate Twitter with a screen reader

GitHub as an example of an accessible web application

Medium.com article page - just adding a "Skip to article" link would be a *huge* improvement!

### Using a screen reader to apply for social assistance programs

[Applying for Social Security Benefits](https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/dib) &  seems to be a good example of accessible content!

At the time of writing [NY.gov's site](http://www.ny.gov/) as well as the NY State's [Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance site](http://otda.ny.gov/accessibility.asp) are beautiful, full of accessible information, and touts an [accessibility policy](http://www.ny.gov/accessibility). Unfortunately, the site that handles the applications for core services such as school meals and nutrition assistance is [anying but accessible](https://mybenefits.ny.gov/mybenefits/NewAccountCreation!input.nysmybw).
