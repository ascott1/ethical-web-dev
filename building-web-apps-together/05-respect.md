# Treating Other Developers with Respect

This will be the shortest chapter of the series, but is likely the most important. It is critical that we treat our colleagues with respect. The primary way we do this is by working to create an inclusive and safe environment for everyone regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, age, or cultural background. Whether it is online, at work, at a meetup, or attending a conference, be kind and respectful to those around you. In this chapter, we'll briefly touch upon unconscious bias and creating inclusive environments.

## Unconscious Bias

In the 1970's the typical orchestra was comprised of over 90% male musicians. Today orchestras are more likely made up of one third female musicians, with likelihood that a woman musician will be selected increasing by 30-60%. What changed to spur this increase in female classical musicians? It was the introduction of blind auditions. Today's selection process has musicians audition without being seen by the judging committee. Early on, this was proven to require further modification as women began removing their shoes, so that judges would not hear the tell-tale sound the shoes made when the musician approached the chair. This is an example of unconscious bias. The judges largely assumed, presumably without intention or awareness of their preference, that men were better musicians. When the chance for this bias was removed, more women were selected.

Unconscious biases are stereotypes that we hold without being explicitly aware of them. They are often the result of quick judgements, which are "a feature of evolution," according to Harvard psychology professor [Mahzarin Banaji](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/opinion/nicholas-kristof-our-biased-brains.html). For early humans it was useful to quickly categorize things, such as predators or potential threats. Today, we retain this skill, and while in many life situations bias serves as a decision making shortcut, it can also have unintended negative consequences, particularly when it applies to how we think about other people.

The fact that these are implicit biases, means that we are making judgements that we are unaware of. Because of this, the first step is to gain awareness of the unconscious biases that we may contain. Harvard's Project Implicit has created a series of [implicit association tests](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html), which allow users to perform a series of online actions that may help to reveal hidden biases.

Recently, Google has undertaken an intensive unconscious bias training effort with employees and offers the training materials as part of their [ReWork project](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/unbiasing-raise-awareness/steps/introduction/). These materials include video information, links to scientific studies, and the full training materials used by Google. Other large tech companies have undertake similar efforts, with Microsoft offering a full [online training module](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/training) and Facebook providing a series of [video lecture modules](https://managingbias.fb.com/).

By becoming more aware of how we may be influenced by our unconscious biases, we are able to improve how we collaborate with our colleagues and peers.


## Creating Welcoming Environments

Just as we discussed creating inclusive spaces for open source projects, we should seek to do the same for physical spaces. Codes of Conduct should also be applied to events such as meetup groups, hackathons, and conferences. If you work for a small company, ensure they also have clear conduct policies in place. Here are a few resources for in-person event codes of conduct:

- [Ada Intiative's HOWTO design a code of conduct for your community](https://adainitiative.org/2014/02/18/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/)
- [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/)
- [Geek Feminism's Conference anti-harassment/Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
- [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/)

Community Manager, Sarah Jane Morris has put together a [guide for hosting inclusive events](https://github.com/SarahJaneMorris/inclusive-events-guide/blob/master/guide.md) which serves as a useful template for creating a positive atmosphere. Though some of the resources are bay area specific, it offers a solid template for creating a welcoming event culture. If we are involved in organizing an event, we may also want to consider alternatives to the typical happy hour or alcohol-centric venues. In her article [Alcohol and Inclusivity: Planning Tech Events with Non-Alcoholic Options](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/alcohol-and-inclusivity-planning-tech-events-with-non-alcoholic-options), Community Manager Kara Sowles suggests five tips for including non-alcoholic drinks at events:

1. Provide an equal number and quality of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink options.
2. Display alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks together at the event.
3. Advertise alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks equally before the event.
4. If listed cocktails are being served, list an equal number of non-alcoholic mocktails.
5. Have water freely available, in clear sight, and easy to obtain.

Taking these types of considerations is not limited to events. In a [profile](http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/techflash/2016/02/how-one-portland-startup-baked-diversity-into-its.html) of the Portland, Oregon startup Paresh Patel the CEO of PayRange discussed the company's decision to re-address some of the typical startup office perks:

> “We don’t have kegs in our office, those can make some people uncomfortable. We don’t have pool tables. We don’t have Friday happy hour. Instead, we have family nights out for dinner, vegetarian microwaves, summer picnics where employees can have fun with their kids.”

These are just a examples of how more welcoming environments are created. By focusing on the needs and well-being of everyone, we are able to build stronger communities.

We must all do our part to create an inclusive work culture. Wether we work remotely or are co-located, we all spend a lot of time with colleagues. For many of us, web development extends beyond being a day job into our social lives and hobbies, where we should also seek to be open and welcoming to all. The guides and articles below are incredibly useful tools for building positive environments.
