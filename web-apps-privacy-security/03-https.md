# Encrypting User Connections with HTTPS

> If only the “controversial” stuff is private, then privacy is itself suspicious. Thus, privacy should be on by default.

— [Tim Bray](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS)

> HTTPS, HTTP over TLS, has been around since 1994, and has been well adopted by the security sensitive web — online banking, shopping, taxes and more. However, the vast majority of websites (est. 81% to 97%) continue to communicate using clear (unencrypted) HTTP — no matter how insecure that is.
