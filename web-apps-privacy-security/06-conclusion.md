# In conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read...

If throughout your reading you have come across things that are missing or could be improved, I would encourage you to contribute back to the book. This title is available as open source and contributions can be made by:

- Contributing directly to the GitHub repository with a pull request <https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev>.
- Creating an issue in the book’s GitHub repository <https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev/issues>.
- Reaching out to me through [email](mailto:adamdscott@protonmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamdscott).

Twenty percent of the proceeds from each Ethical Web Development title will be donated to an organization whose work has a positive impact on the issues described. For this title, I will be donating to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The EFF "champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development." The work and research of the EFF was instrumental to the research involved in this title.

If you are interested in supporting the EFF's work please consider getting involved at [eff.org](https://www.eff.org).

This title is the first in a series of digital reports I am authoring on the subject of ethical web development. Future titles in the series will cover building web applications that work everywhere, building web applications that respect a user's privacy and security, and working with development peers. You can learn more about the series at [ethicalweb.org](https://ethicalweb.org).
